The project is an automatic ice fishing setup. A JawJacker is an automatic hook setting device common in ice fishing. Utilizing an Arduino, DC Motor, DC Motor Driver, an Ultrasonic Sensor, a 12V battery, and some jumper wires, this project combines an idea with physical motion to create an applicable device. The DC motor will be connected to the reel of the ice fishing rod. It will be powered through a 12V battery and controlled by the Arduino through the DC Motor Driver. The Arduino will use the ultrasonic sensor to determine if the hook has been set.
